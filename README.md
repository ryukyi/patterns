# Patterns and Concepts

## Patterns

This section contains implementations of various design patterns. Each file demonstrates a specific pattern, providing a practical example of how the pattern can be applied in real-world scenarios. The patterns covered include but are not limited to:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory**: Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Controller**: Manages input, converting it to commands for the model or view.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Demonstrates core OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation through examples involving bank accounts.

## Concepts and Expressions

This section delves into fundamental programming concepts and expressions, focusing on how they are implemented in Python. It includes examples that illustrate:

- **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize via instantiation, allowing you to reuse your design solutions in many different situations.

Each file within these sections is designed to be a standalone example, making it easy to explore and understand the principles behind each pattern and concept.
